# Metrical Search

With this search mode, you can search for metrical patterns.

## Usage

There is metrical data associated with some text versions, of which you can choose the one you want to search in using the dropdown menu.  
The metrical data is composed of markers for short and long syllables. They are displayed in a stanza's data as `—` for a long and `◡` for a short syllable.

To make searching in this data easier, you have to use `L` for a long and `S` for a short syllable. You can also search for multiple "words" in any order, or even in a fixed order by using a quoted "phrase search" (e.g. `"LSS SL"`).

## Wildcards

It's also possible to use **wildcards** (just like in the _Quick search_ at the top of the page), e.g. searching for `LLS*` would match all words starting with this metrical pattern. Likewise, `LLS?` would find words with four syllables, where the last one can be long _or_ short.

**Please be aware that you _cannot use wildcards in a phrase search_!**
